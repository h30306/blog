## Intuition

We can solve this problem by thinking about it in reverse. Instead of finding the minimum number of operations to reduce `x` to zero, we can find the maximum length of a subarray whose sum equals `sum(nums) - x`. This is because if we remove elements from both ends to reduce `x` to zero, the remaining elements must sum to `sum(nums) - x`. The minimum operations needed will be `len(nums) - max_subarray_length`.

## Approach

### Reverse Thinking with Sliding Window
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        
        target_sum = sum(nums) - x

        # Handle edge cases
        if target_sum < 0:
            return -1
        if target_sum == 0:
            return len(nums)
    
        max_len = 0
        left = sum_now = 0

        # Find maximum subarray with sum equal to target_sum
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            sum_now += nums[right]

            # Shrink window if sum exceeds target
            while sum_now > target_sum:
                sum_now -= nums[left]
                left += 1
            
            # Update maximum length if sum equals target
            if sum_now == target_sum:
                max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)

        return len(nums) - max_len if max_len != 0 else -1
```

## Algorithm Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) where n is the length of the input array
- **Space**: O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space

### Key Insights
1. **Reverse Thinking**: Transform the problem to find maximum subarray with specific sum
2. **Sliding Window**: Use sliding window to find the longest subarray with target sum
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle cases where target sum is negative or zero

## Findings

1. **Reverse Problem Transformation**: This problem demonstrates how thinking about a problem in reverse can simplify the solution. Instead of finding minimum operations, we find the maximum subarray length.

2. **Sliding Window Application**: The transformed problem becomes a classic sliding window problem - finding the longest subarray with a specific sum.

3. **Target Sum Calculation**: The key insight is that `target_sum = sum(nums) - x` represents the sum of elements we want to keep in the middle.

4. **Window Management**: We maintain a sliding window and adjust its size based on whether the current sum equals, exceeds, or is less than the target sum.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: We need to handle several edge cases: when target sum is negative (impossible), when target sum is zero (remove all elements), and when no valid subarray is found.

6. **Result Calculation**: The final result is `len(nums) - max_len`, representing the number of elements we need to remove from both ends.

7. **Single Pass Solution**: The solution requires only one pass through the array, making it very efficient for large inputs.

8. **Memory Efficiency**: O(1) space complexity makes this solution very memory-efficient, as we only need a few variables to track the current state.

## Encountered Problems 

1. **Initial Approach Confusion**: I initially tried to solve this directly by removing elements from both ends, which was complex and inefficient. The key insight was the reverse thinking approach.

2. **Target Sum Understanding**: Understanding that `target_sum = sum(nums) - x` was crucial. I had to think carefully about what this represents in the context of the original problem.

3. **Edge Case Management**: I had to handle multiple edge cases: negative target sum, zero target sum, and cases where no valid subarray exists.
